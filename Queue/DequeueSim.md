# ðŸ§¾Dequeue (Double-Ended Queue) Implementation in JavaScript

## âœ… What is a Dequeue?

A Dequeue (Double-Ended Queue) is a linear data structure that allows insertion and deletion from both the front and the rear ends.

Unlike a standard queue (FIFO), a dequeue supports:

    Insertion at both front and rear

    Deletion from both front and rear

For large-scale use, consider using a linked list or circular buffer to maintain efficiency.

## âœ… When to Use Dequeue?

- Palindrome checking

- Sliding window problems

- Undo/Redo functionality

- Scheduling tasks
